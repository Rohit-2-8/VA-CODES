the app.py and dashboard.py along with spermarket_sales is a standalone code. Run it to get output
the app2.py and create_db.py along with supermarket_sales is another standalone code . this is a code without streamit, more for creating a db using flask
NOTE: the dataset name can change inside the codes from 'supermarke_sales' to other related names. just rename the file after download instead of panicking.
